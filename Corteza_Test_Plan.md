# Test Plan for Corteza Application

## 1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the strategy, scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for testing the Corteza application. The primary goal is to ensure the app's functionality, performance, security, and usability meet the expected standards before release.

## 2. Test Objectives
- Verify core functionalities such as user management, data modeling, and workflow automation.
- Validate the applicationâ€™s performance under different workloads.
- Ensure security compliance for user data protection.
- Test UI/UX consistency across different devices and screen resolutions.
- Identify and resolve critical bugs before deployment.

## 3. Scope of Testing
The following areas will be covered:
- **Functional Testing**: User authentication, role-based access control, module management, workflow execution, API interactions.
- **UI/UX Testing**: Interface consistency, navigation, usability.
- **Performance Testing**: Application response time, load handling, stress testing.
- **Security Testing**: Data encryption, authentication, penetration testing.
- **Compatibility Testing**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari), different screen resolutions.
- **Integration Testing**: External system integrations (REST API, third-party services).

## 4. Testing Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Initial verification of all core functionalities.
- **Automated Testing**: Regression and repetitive test cases using tools like Selenium, Cypress.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Unscripted testing to uncover unexpected issues.

## 5. Test Environment
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **Tools**: Jira (Bug Tracking), Postman (API Testing), Selenium/Cypress (Automation), OWASP ZAP (Security Testing).

## 6. Test Deliverables
- Test Cases and Test Scripts
- Test Execution Report
- Bug Reports
- Performance Benchmarking Report
- Final Test Summary Report

## 7. Defect Management
- All identified defects will be logged in Jira.
- Defects will be categorized based on severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Weekly bug triage meetings will be held to prioritize fixes.

## 8. Risks & Mitigation Plan
- **System Complexity**: Conduct regular knowledge-sharing sessions among testers.
- **Integration Issues**: Perform API testing early in the cycle.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Conduct periodic penetration testing.
